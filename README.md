# PowerBI-Project

Functions Used:

1. Data Source Connection: Power BI allows you to connect to various data. In this dashboard, the data source could be a database or a spreadsheet containing information about pizza sales.

2. Data Modeling: Power BI provides a data modeling feature that allows you to create relationships between different tables in your data source. For example, you can establish relationships between a "Sales" table and a "Pizza Types" table to analyze the sales performance of each pizza type.

3. Data Transformation: Power Query, a built-in feature of Power BI, enables you to transform and shape your data before loading it into the data model. This step includes cleaning data, removing duplicates, merging tables, and creating calculated columns. For instance, you might need to calculate total sales by summing up the sales amounts for each pizza order.

4. Visualizations: Power BI offers a wide range of interactive visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps. These visual elements can be customized with different colors, labels, and formatting options.

5. Filters and Slicers: Power BI allows you to add filters and slicers to your dashboard, enabling users to interactively slice and dice the data. For example, you could add a filter to select a specific time period or region, and the visuals would automatically update to reflect the filtered data.

6. Drill-through and Drill-down: Power BI supports drill-through and drill-down capabilities, allowing users to explore data at different levels of detail. For instance, users can drill down from the overall sales performance to see sales by individual pizza stores or drill through from a specific pizza type to view the sales details for that type.

7. Dashboard Interactions: Power BI lets you create interactive dashboards where users can select specific visual elements to cross-highlight or filter other visuals. This feature facilitates a dynamic exploration of the data and helps users gain insights quickly.

8. By utilizing these functions, the Pizza Sale Dashboard in Power BI provides a comprehensive overview of pizza sales performance, allowing users to analyze sales by pizza type, time period, and other relevant dimensions. The interactive and visually appealing nature of Power BI enables users to gain actionable insights and make informed business decisions in the context of pizza sales.
